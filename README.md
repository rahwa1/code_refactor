# code_refactor

This project was built by the professor and was given to students so that the code could be refactored. 

The problem for this project wasn't a syntax error it was more so that the code could be clean and easy to read. The html file didn't have much to clean but the css file had a lot of repetition. 

The Website was working even when the assignment was assigned, the only thing that I was supposed to do was to work on how to make the code look nicer. 

In the css file there were a lot of class elements that had the same size and style and so they were defined multiple times, since they were in the same div I used the div name.img for example and added all the properties in one. 

One of the things I have learned while doing this is that .content is it's own box, so when I kept adding the contents of images and headers into it, it kept messing up the website and I found out that .content would also take the same elements from the images and headers therefore the properties for images and headers had to be separate.
